🦄 Delulu GPT

Where reality is a suggestion.

Delulu GPT is a quirky, soulful AI experience where users can input their fears, dreams, or intrusive thoughts and choose their vibe: grounded realism or wild, delusional hype.

🧠 Modes

Reality Mode: Offers warm, emotionally intelligent tech-mentor advice.

Delulu Mode: Delivers maximum chaos, glitter, and encouragement.

Choose your lens, rewrite your inner monologue.
